This project lets you use the inky pad as an e-reader. Add a text file to your pico, and it will seperate the text into pages and let you scroll through the text to read.

Follow the instructions from the [Pimoroni Github Page](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/blob/main/setting-up-micropython.md), and then download these files to your pico to start using your pico as a tiny e-reader
